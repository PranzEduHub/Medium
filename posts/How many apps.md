**How many apps should we have on our smartphones, productivity wise and abiding minimalistic lifestyle choices, best practices?**

If you are already asking that question, you maybe should cut on a few. The best measure to find a perfect balance, is not how many, but what do those apps do for you.

Do they serve any function? And for what predominantly you use your phone? Work, entertainment, free time, news reading, socializing? It is up to you.

You may use one app that can perform many tasks, and limit your notifications. If you have various contact, productivity or tool apps, but you don’t use them all that often, you don’t really need them.

Leave in what you need the most, your battery will be grateful.

My dream would be around 20 apps.

**What is the best combination of 20 apps for active blogger with social media presence, plus a few tools and a few leisure applications?**

I would give a very simple advice to whoever wants it.

Remove everything work-wise, leave a main contact app and use a smartphone to relax instead using it for anything job related.

You can’t see all the joy from the wall of the obligations. You don’t need to do that.
