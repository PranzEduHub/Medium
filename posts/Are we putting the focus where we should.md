I contemplated social marketing and whether it is useful or not. We know that is not exactly an activity anyone is particularly happy about. Unless you are socially starved and have no life beyond your digital semblance.

Anyways, agreed or not, there is a bigger chance that matured Facebook population is about to buy something from their favorite social media website, then any other group. We can argue about that conclusion, but nobody actually goes on Gettr, Reddit, Gab, Twitter or Mastodon to buy stuff. Or some other social network that is mostly populated by young people whose buying power is still in development phase.

I doubt that all the other websites, including Twitter, because that thing just got re-hatched recently into who knows what, have a mature population with serious relationship with the website.

So, all the other website which just sprouted, unless a user feels an ideological connection should be off limit for the marketers and sellers. Until a website confirms the benefit for the user base.

This includes Gettr, PostNews, HiveSocialApp, Blind and CohostOrg.

The oldest of them, Gettr, was created in 2021. It is verifying users through the typeform which has spelling mistakes. Why?

Post looks decent, but withdraw is manual. Again, why?

HiveSocialApp. How many networks or websites already took upon that name? Also, why some of my profile features are “not feeling good”? Could it be easier to just disengage them completely? Also, my pronouns are who/where/lol and I identify as a person.

Blind, or TeamBlind — still in early development and it is meant to be for companies exclusively. My account is in read-only mode. I can’t do anything with it. Functionalities such as work email confirmation is not even available besides on a smartphone. Why?

Cohost seems decent, but we will see about that.
