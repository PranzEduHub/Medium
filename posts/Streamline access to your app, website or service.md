**One simple way to do this is using application aggregators. You most definitely used a lot of these, without knowing what they are.**

Application aggregators are platforms that consolidate multiple apps and services into a single interface, simplifying user interaction and eliminating the need to navigate between various platforms. Examples include app stores like Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store, as well as alternative options like Aptoide. AppAgg stands out among them, providing comprehensive information, user accounts, and unbiased reviews.

Service aggregators, such as GrubHub, TaskRabbit, Upwork, Uber, and Airbnb, bring together various service providers, offering users a convenient way to access and utilize different services. News aggregators like Google News, Flipboard, Apple News, Feedly, and News360 gather news articles from multiple sources, making it easier for users to find and read news on specific topics or create personalized news feeds.

Another useful types are the payment aggregators like PayPal, Stripe, Square, Adyen, and Braintree simplify payment management by allowing users to make transactions through various payment methods on a single platform. These aggregators benefit businesses and individuals by streamlining payment processes and financial management.
