Twitter will charge 10% platform fees after 1 year free. Do you think it is exaggerated? Let’s compare it to the competition.

# Green Group

- doesn’t have any platform fees or extremely low.

Ko-Fi, Github, Liberapay and BuyMeACoffee seems to have the lowest cost for creators.

  
| Name            | Platform Fee | Processing Fee                   |  
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------|  
| Ko-Fi           | 0%           | 2.9% to 3.5% + $0.30 per transaction |  
| Github          | 0%           | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction        |  
| Liberapay       | 0% to 5%     | 1.5% to 2.5% + €0.25 per transaction |  
| BuyMeACoffee    | 0% to 5%     | 2.9% to 3.5% + $0.30 per transaction |

# Yellow Group

- takes a portion of earnings but significantly less than Twitter would.

| Name            | Platform Fee | Processing Fee                   |  
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------|  
| SteadyHQ        | 5%           | 2.9% + €0.25 per transaction |  
| OpenCollective  | 5%           | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction |  
| Kickstarter     | 5%           | 3-5% + $0.20 per pledge |

# Red Group

- almost as equal or significantly more than Twitter.

| Name            | Platform Fee | Processing Fee                   |  
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------|  
| Substack        | 10%          | 2.9% to 3.5% + $0.30 per transaction |  
| Patreon         | 5% to 12%    | 2.9% to 5% + $0.30 per transaction |  
| OnlyFans        | 20%          | 4% to 5% + $0.05 to $0.10 per transaction |  
| Gumroad         | 8.5% + $0.30 | 3.5% + $0.30 per transaction |  
| Flattr          | 7.5%         | 0% to 2.9% + €0.30 per transaction |  
| YouTube         | 0%           | **30%** (YouTube's cut of membership revenue) |  
| Twitch Subs     | **50% for affiliates, 70% for partners** | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction |  
| Udemy           | 3% to 75%    | 3% to 5% per transaction |  
| Skillshare      | 50%          | N/A (included in monthly subscription fee) |  
| Memberful       | 10% to 25%   | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction |

YouTube charges 0% platform fees for creators who offer membership to their audience through the YouTube platform. However, YouTube takes a cut of 30% from the revenue earned by the creator from the membership program. This means that if a creator earns $100 from membership subscriptions, YouTube will take $30 as its cut and the creator will receive $70.

All of these websites go under no-thank you category. And I don’t believe I will be making any money whatsoever with them.

Using it as a video preview /hosting platform seems good enough, but I don’t want to combat their copyright engine, false claims which usually temporarily take off my content, and the fact that I make absolutely nothing off it but additionally enrichen a platform.
