We have a website, but because we don’t want to use an expensive and overbearing newsletter app, the Medium is a great choice. Even if not monetized.

Content should be on par with what we have on our page, or website, but shorter, concise and … less words in total.

Posts in here should be simple and easy to digest, and if a person is interested in a certain topic they can read the lengthy articles right off the webpage.

Medium newsletter/post also can include certain improvements we made on a website.

Medium is ideal because the stories are already optimized for a simple preview and email looks decent and very easy to read on mobile devices.

There is no need for a heavy application and that is one big reason why we decided to use Medium instead of other, default newsletter apps.

What about images?

I think that one single, cover image is quite enough for a daily newsletter, or a post on Medium. Too much clutter would just complicate the whole experience.

Wordcount will be kept on about 250–300 words with maximum 3 topics included in daily post. This will provide enough content without cluttering.

For now it is just one topic.

What about links?

There will be no links included into our posts, none directly linking. A person can easily find all of that on our website, we have an excellent search engine.
