You are signing up for a website, and you want to avoid listening all the sad stories on YouTube or fake and possibly paid, misleading reviews? Where to find a valid information and honest review about a website you want to join but know very little or nothing?

It wouldn’t be the first time that YouTube influencers promote a fraud, so watching a review on that network, on anything, is not a valid source of information.

So, if a website is not a downright fraud, the opinions about any website are highly subjective and it only depends on your expectation if that particular website is the best fit for you.

You can find reviews on a websites such as Trustpilot, Sitejabber, AlternativeTo, Product Hunt and even Google shop. There are specialized websites that employ product reviewers, such as BeerMoneyForum where you can find insights about almost any website that offers a service, payment or similar.

You can also see into the Reddit, Quora, your local network on Mastodon or Discord, and take a look at the website traffic trends to see if you can find a relevant information.

If you are strictly interested into joining a website in order to monetize your participation or blogging, then it is very important to study their terms, rules, how they pay, which countries are included into their scheme… and anything that may suggest if a website fulfils your expectation. For various reasons, this could be a hefty assignment for most of the people, so Quora experts might come very handy to resolve your doubt.
