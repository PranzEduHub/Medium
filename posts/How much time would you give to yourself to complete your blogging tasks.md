This is a daily schedule list for the blogging. How much time would you give to yourself to complete these tasks?

Note: These times are just approximations.

| Total time:                                                             | 19 hours 30 minutes to 28 hours 30 minutes |

Too much!

Wasting 6–12 hours online is unachievable, and that is just for blogging.  
But wasting more hours than there is in a day, is impossible.  
Something has to give.

We will make it possible by kicking out whatever is not absolutely necessary.

OK, so we will split this huge table into two parts.

First part will be everything that is not directly related to writing those blog posts, or Tasks, and another will be only about Writing.

Then from Tasks remove whatever you don’t need to do on a daily basis, put in another table and remove best performance time, as you are going to do that occasionally.

Then you will remove any sort of a sponsored content as that one will be either paused, or you will sell advertising space or membership on your own website. So, this at this moment is not urgent.

The next you will remove social media websites and engagement and dedicate it to a special category called Engagement.  
You will include all social media accounts and any sort of interaction and commenting into this category, with a list of website you will use.  
And then you will dedicate a time lot to that activity only, and the recommended time for most humans is 2 hours maximum per day of online social interaction.

Now you will create another category called Automation, and put under it all tasks you can automate. This means they can run and operate without touching anything.

  
| Tasks                                                                | Best Performance Time |

| 13. Creating graphics or other visual content for blog posts            | 1-2 hours            |  
  
| Automation                                                               | Best Performance Time |

| **Total:**               |    2 hours      |  
  
| Monthly/ or per need                                                  |  Best Performance Time |  
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|  
| 2. Review website analytics to identify trends and opportunities        |                  |  
| 10. Monitor your online reputation                              |          |        
| 14. Updating and maintaining website design and functionality           |      |

| 15. Responding to sponsored content inquiries and negotiating rates     |        |  
| 16. Collaborating with other bloggers or brands on sponsored content     |            |

Now when you have 2 hours of engagement with about 1 hour plus for emails, news and graphics, things don’t look so grim.

Let’s see the other part of a table.

This will be the next two hours, or in case this is a primary activity for that day or in average you can take as much time as you wish.

Some things during this process can be done by an app, so you will remove them from the Writing and put them into App category.  
Editing and proofreading can be done by Grammarly, ChatGPT or any writing tool you find useful and easy to use.

| Writing                                                                | Best Performance Time |  
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|  
| 3. Create and publish a new blog post                                   | 2-4 hours             |  
| 11. Conducting research for blog posts                                   | 1-3 hours            |  
| Average:                                   | 3 hours            |  
  
  
| Apps                                                              | Best Performance Time |  
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|  
| 12. Editing and proofreading blog posts                                  |        |  
| 8. Brainstorm ideas for future blog posts and create an editorial calendar |             |

It still looks like a lot, but many of these groups you can complete from your phone on a go, or when you get bored of one activity, you may jump to another to refresh yourself.

Having an Editorial calendar is a great way to have everything organized and then complete tasks when you have time, when it is the most convenient for you and to complete them in a bulk, and if possible automate and schedule, so you can concentrate on the creative process more and to your audience.
