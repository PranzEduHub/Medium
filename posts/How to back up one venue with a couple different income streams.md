Much easier said than done.

If you have one blog on a certain topic, back it up with paid/monetized guest blogging, and then add an alternative guest blog or become a contributor to a similar website to have an option more.

If you already know the craft, it will be easy to utilize your knowledge. But, never add too many, you will not have enough time.

From a single blog you can jot down more than a few ideas, maybe a few images, a cover art, a mind map… something that you can post on a visual app of your choice, or sell it as graphics. Then you add a similar service, so you have it doubled.

Now, you covered a written and visual expressions, let’s go deeper.

You can chose one social media network, that you like the best, and share your work there. Accompany it with one more network, so that you have a backup.

If you can sell something, sell it on two websites.  
Create donation accounts, on two websites.  
Create videos, on two websites.  
Podcast? Same thing.

You will only create a content once, but you can diversify it.

An each of these things can benefit your blog directly, or separately be a different source of income on their own.

Make absolutely sure to create a great plan for those websites, and make sure to do a good job without wasting too much time on an each.
