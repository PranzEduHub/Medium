I know by the experience that a long form no matter how much my mentors, all those “professional” bloggers foam mouthfuls of appraisals about it, will not get me anywhere with high volume websites. It is for the blogs. And I usually write too long.

Those times when people had a decent attention span and wish to ferment the last calory of your divine work — have left the planet. I tried a few ideas during the previous month, but they didn’t bring much of the feedback.

Content received little to no feedback, ONCE the day expired. So, the next day that content just disappeared from the feed, never to be seen again.

Instead of writing a very long sausage posts, better concentrate on a short, concise and clear. If that what I write will disappear in just a day, I don’t believe that using thousands of the words to communicate my message is necessary.
